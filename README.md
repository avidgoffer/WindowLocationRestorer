WindowLocationRestorer
======================

Restore window locations to the last monitor they were seen on.


Are you frustrated when you remove a monitor and then add it back your windows do not snap back to where they were or when you undock your laptop for a meeting and then redock all your windows are on top of each other on the primary window and you have to drag them back to where they were?

This is my attempt to fix that.
